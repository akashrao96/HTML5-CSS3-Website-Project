#HTML5-Website-Project

HTML5 Website With A Responsive Layout

In this project,I created a clean coded responsive mobile friendly HTML5 website for a fictional web design company.

I used semantic HTML tags like header and footer as well as the basics of HTML and CSS. This is a great project for beginners.
